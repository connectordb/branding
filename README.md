ConnectorDB Branding Guidelines
===============================

Name
----

In documentation the name of the project is stylized `ConnectorDB` *not* 
`ConnectorDb` or `Connectordb`.

It is acceptable and preferable to use `connectordb` in file names, source code, 
git repos and the like to facilitate find/replace and tab completion.

The name should be in a sans-serif font, preferably Montserrat which is an open
font.

Logo
----

The connectordb logo is Copyright 2015 Joseph Lewis and Daniel Kumor. 
Permission is granted to use it for all official ConnectorDB projects associated
with the ConnectorDB github organization and/or references to said projects e.g.
in news articles, endorsements, emails and blog posts.

Permission is not granted to use the logo in any projects not associated with the ConnectorDB projects, such as forks of the original software.

The logo looks best over a white, gray or black background.
