ConnectorDB Branding Guidelines
===============================

Name
----

In documentation the name of the project is stylized `ConnectorDB` *not* 
`ConnectorDb` or `Connectordb`.

It is acceptable and preferable to use `connectordb` in file names, source code, 
git repos and the like to facilitate find/replace and tab completion.

The name should be in a sans-serif font, preferably Montserrat which is an open
font.

Logo
----

The connectordb logo is Copyright 2016 Joseph Lewis and Daniel Kumor. 
Permission is granted to use it for all official ConnectorDB projects associated
with the ConnectorDB github organization and/or references to said projects e.g.
in news articles, endorsements, emails and blog posts.

Permission is also granted to use the logo for showing compatibility with the ConnectorDB software (ex: devices which sync with ConnectorDB). In such cases, the logo must be shown in a way which does not allow said software/hardware to be reasonably mistaken for an official or endorsed ConnectorDB project. Valid examples include statements such as "Compatible with ConnectorDB {{logo}}" or "For use with ConnectorDB {{logo}}".


Permission is *not* granted to use the logo in any projects not associated with ConnectorDB, including forks of the original software.

The logo looks best over a white, gray or black background.
